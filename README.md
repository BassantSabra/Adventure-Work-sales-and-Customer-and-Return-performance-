3. Data Preparation (Power Query Steps)

Data was imported from AdventureWorks sales tables and cleaned using Power Query:

Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates, null values, and unused columns.

Standardized date formats.

Created calculated columns for Year, Month, Week.

Transformations

Merged sales, products, and customer tables.

Normalized product categories and subcategories.

Added income level and occupation segmentation for customer analysis.

Modeling

Established star schema (FactSales linked to DimCustomer, DimProduct, DimDate).

Relationships set to single direction for optimized performance.

4. DAX Measures & Calculations

Several measures were created to support analysis:

Revenue = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])

Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])

Orders = COUNTROWS(Sales)

Return Rate = (SUM(Returns[Qty]) / SUM(Sales[Qty]))

Revenue per Customer = [Revenue] / DISTINCTCOUNT(Customer[CustomerID])

YoY Growth = (Current Revenue â€“ Previous Year Revenue) / Previous Year Revenue
